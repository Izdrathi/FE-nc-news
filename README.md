# Northcoders News

## 1. Introduction

Nortcoders news is a frontend application to display data received from backend and showcase my React knowledge. Homepage displays a lit of all articles and allows user to login (for now it's just one user to allow certain functionality within the page) - you can click on the article to read it fully and also (if logged in) post comments and increase votes on the articles.

It was created during my time with Nortcoders as my frontend solo project.
